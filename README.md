# TasksApp üìù

Frontend was built using React with Context API and Provider for state management. It was tested using RTL (React Testing Library) and offers a user-friendly, responsive interface. It was used Bootstrap for styling, providing an interactive user experience.

The backend of the application is built using Express.js. It includes an endpoint to retrieve tasks and adds new tasks every minute. Tasks are stored in a Map object. This backend serves as a simulated API for the TasksApp frontend, allowing tasks retrieval and dynamic updates.

## Features

- Show task count by status.
- Filter tasks by completion status.
- Filter tasks by pending status.
- Paginate tasks for easier navigation.
